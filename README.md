v1.0 Changelog (What We Built)
Cinematic Theme Engine: Replaced standard dark mode toggle with a Lottie-sync system. The theme now snaps exactly when the "Wolf Howls" or "Sun Rises".

Physics & Haptics: Added a Screen Shake effect and vibration feedback synchronized with the animation impact to give the app "weight".

Glass-Morphism UI: Implemented transparent, blurry card backgrounds for the Header and Filter cards to modernize the look.

Smart Charts 2.0: Upgraded from a messy pie chart to a clean Doughnut Chart.

Hidden Labels: Removed text from slices to reduce clutter.

Interactive Center: Tapping a slice updates the center text with the specific Category & Amount.

Synced List: Added a scrollable RecyclerView list below the chart that automatically scrolls to the selected item.

Indian Localization: Enforced Locale("en", "IN") for all currency formatting (e.g., ₹1,35,426).

Gamified Branding: Added a custom Mario "Money Flow" Icon and "Squish" physics to buttons.

App Capabilities (What It Can Do)
Track Finances: Log Income and Expenses with categories (Food, Travel, etc.) and emojis.

Visual Analysis: View spending breakdowns via an interactive, animated doughnut chart sorted by highest expense.

Immersive Theming: Switch between Light/Dark mode with a full-screen "Spirit Animal" animation that physically shakes the UI.

Secure & Private: Includes a biometric/PIN lock overlay (App Lock) to protect financial data.

Budget Monitoring: Set monthly budgets and track total balance in real-time.
